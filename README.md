# Twitch Streamer Tracker

This front-end application tracks Twitch streamers and displays which of them are currently streaming along with the game they are playing and how many people are watching.

## Motivation

This is an updated version of a project that was originally build as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification. It is largely the same but updated to work with the current version of the Twitch API.

## Features

- Displays a list of Twitch streamers
- Streamers who are live have a green background, streamers who are offline have a pinkish background
- The user can click on a streamer's information to be taken directly to their Twitch channel
- Live streams also include information as to the game being play, the stream title, and the number of viewers
- The list of streamers can be sorted by all, online or offline

## Future Improvements

- Allow the user the option to add or remove streamers from the list
